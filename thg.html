                    <li>Data overload prevented users from identifying strategic opportunities</li>
                    <li>No clear visual hierarchy to prioritize critical performance indicators</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="stat-box">
                <span class="number">15,000+</span>
                <span class="label">metrics needed to be accessible and comparable</span>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
            <p>Working within an agile environment at Endava for The Hackett Group client, I conducted comprehensive user research to understand the complex needs of finance executives and data collectors.</p>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>1. Empathize Phase</h4>
                <p>Conducted stakeholder interviews with CTO and CEO, followed by extensive user interviews with finance team members and data collectors to understand their workflows, pain points, and time constraints.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Insights from Research</h3>
            <div class="insight-grid">
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Time-Constrained Users</h4>
                    <p>Senior finance team members had limited time to explore interfaces—they needed immediate access to critical insights without extensive navigation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Comparative Analysis Need</h4>
                    <p>Users needed to compare multiple metrics side-by-side simultaneously to identify patterns and make strategic decisions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Complex User Roles</h4>
                    <p>Different user types (Program Managers, PTE Managers, Data Collectors, Stakeholders) required different levels of access and functionality.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Data Collector Workflow</h4>
                    <p>Internal data collection process was disconnected from end-user display, creating inconsistencies and delays in metric updates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Missing Context</h4>
                    <p>Raw metrics without context or benchmarks provided little actionable value for decision-making.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Excellence Quadrant Focus</h4>
                    <p>Users specifically needed to identify metrics contributing to the "excellence quadrant"—The Hackett Group's key differentiator.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>2. Define Phase</h4>
                <p>Created user journeys and user flows mapping core functionalities. Developed user personas for different roles (Data Collectors, Finance Managers, Executives) to understand how each would complete tasks and what information they needed along the way.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Core Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>How might we help <strong>senior finance executives </strong><strong>efficiently navigate, compare, and extract strategic insights </strong>from 15,000+ benchmarking metrics without <strong>overwhelming them with data complexity</strong>?</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Design Process</h2>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>3. Ideate & Prototype</h4>
                <p>Facilitated collaborative sessions with the 10-member team using Whimsical boards to create flowcharts and user stories. Rapidly iterated on concepts through sketching, wireframing, and functional mockups in Figma.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Solution 1: Multi-Panel Comparison Dashboard</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Users needed to compare multiple metrics simultaneously but the existing interface only allowed viewing one metric panel at a time.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Designed a flexible grid-based dashboard that allowed users to display multiple metric panels side-by-side. Implemented quick-switch functionality enabling users to toggle between different metric views without losing context or position.</p>

            <div class="insight-grid">
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Grid-Based Layout</h4>
                    <p>Flexible panel system allowing 2-4 metrics displayed simultaneously for direct comparison</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Quick-Switch Navigation</h4>
                    <p>One-click metric switching without page reloads or lost context</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Customizable Views</h4>
                    <p>Users could save and recall preferred metric combinations for recurring analysis</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Solution 2: Visual Data Hierarchy & Excellence Indicators</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> With 15,000+ metrics, users struggled to identify which data points were most critical for strategic decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Implemented a clear visual hierarchy using color-coding and excellence indicators. Designed a scoring system that highlighted metrics contributing to the "excellence quadrant"—helping users focus on high-impact performance areas.</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Color-coded performance tiers (Excellent, Good, Average, Below Average)</li>
                <li>Excellence quadrant badges highlighting top-performing metrics</li>
                <li>Comparative advantage indicators showing where organizations excel vs. peers</li>
                <li>Trend arrows and sparklines for quick pattern recognition</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solution 3: Contextual Benchmarking Display</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Raw metrics without peer comparison context provided limited actionable insight.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Integrated industry benchmarking directly into each metric panel, showing where the organization stood relative to peers, industry averages, and best-in-class performers.</p>

            <h3>Solution 4: Guided Onboarding & Presentation Mode</h3>
            <p><strong>The Discovery:</strong> During development, we realized new users needed guidance to understand the platform's extensive capabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Designed a comprehensive onboarding tour and added a presentation mode feature (my suggestion, approved after team discussion). This allowed users to create slide-based reports directly from dashboard data for executive presentations.</p>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>4. Test & Iterate</h4>
                <p>Conducted A/B testing and usability studies throughout development. Used dynamic mockups in consecutive client meetings to explain, discuss, test, and rethink design decisions. Ensured deliverables matched client needs within the proposed timeframe.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Scope & Constraints Management</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Original Timeline:</strong> 4-6 months for core functionality</p>
                <p><strong>Extended Timeline:</strong> 7 months after adding presentation functionality (2-week addition that significantly increased value)</p>
                <p><strong>Key Constraint:</strong> Designing for multiple user roles (Data Collectors, Program Managers, PTE Managers, Stakeholders) each with different needs and technical proficiency levels.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>This project presented unique challenges in designing for data-intensive enterprise platforms with diverse user needs and massive scale requirements.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><strong>Context is king in data visualization:</strong> Raw metrics without benchmarking context provided minimal value—users needed comparative frameworks to understand performance</li>
                <li><strong>User role diversity requires flexible architecture:</strong> Different personas (Data Collectors, Managers, Executives) needed different information density and interaction patterns within the same platform</li>
                <li><strong>Collaborative iteration accelerates alignment:</strong> Figma's collaborative features enabled real-time feedback loops with developers and product owners, significantly reducing miscommunication</li>
                <li><strong>Feature discovery happens during development:</strong> The onboarding tour and presentation mode weren't in the original scope but emerged as critical needs through user testing</li>
                <li><strong>Agile methodology enables adaptive design:</strong> Working in an agile environment allowed us to extend the timeline strategically when high-value features (presentation mode) were identified</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Collaboration & Cross-Functional Impact</h3>
            <p>Worked closely with data collectors team in Montevideo to understand metric collection workflows and ensure seamless integration between data input and user-facing display. Collaborated with business stakeholders through regular meetings using Whimsical boards for flowcharts and user stories. Maintained constant communication with the 10-member development team through Figma, ensuring design specifications were technically feasible and aligned with backend capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Design System Contribution</h3>
            <p>Created reusable components for data visualization, metric comparison panels, and excellence indicators that became part of The Hackett Group's design system. These components were later used across other platform features, demonstrating the value of systematic design thinking.</p>
