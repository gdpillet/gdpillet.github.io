            <h2>The Dual-Edge Approach</h2>

                    <h3><span class="icon"></span>Technical Viability & Scalability</h3>
                    <p>My first four years (2010-2014), as a Web Developer equipped me for API Orchestration and technically complex design, which gave me a unique skill set as both a designer and builder. I've maintained fluency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript allowing me to evaluate user's needs, interface directly with engineering teams, implement data-driven patterns, accelerate QA and launch release new experiences.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="edge-card enterprise">
                    <h3><span class="icon"></span>Enterprise Strategy & Impact</h3>
                    <p>My focus is on generating and articulating differentiated value. I specialize in creating compelling value propositions for every design solution, driving quantifiable success and customer adoption. I connect business impact metrics directly with meaningful user engagement, from strategic roadmaps to user adoption flows.</p>

            <h2>Design Focused on Business Value</h2>

           <div class="dual-edge-grid">
                <h3>Business Impact and Results</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Value:</strong> My main job is to create design solutions that bring <strong>clear and measurable value</strong> to the business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proof of Success:</strong> I don't just design; I drive <strong>quantifiable success</strong> and customer adoption. For example, my work has led to a <strong>25% increase in Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)</strong> and a <strong>3.5x improvement in loan origination</strong> (getting more users to take out loans).</li>
                    <li>My goal is to make sure every design decision helps the company reach its main goals, from strategy to the final product.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="dual-edge-grid">
                <h3>Research, Analysis, and Strategy</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data-Informed Decisions:</strong> My design process is rooted in <strong>quantitative data</strong> (numbers for business outcomes) and <strong>qualitative research</strong> (understanding why users do what they do).</li>
                    <li><strong>Understanding Complexity:</strong> I analyze usage data using tools like Mixpanel, FullStory, and Hotjar to get clear, actionable insights. This data helps me define the product scope and solve complex problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Leadership:</strong> I lead <strong>discovery and strategic planning</strong> with stakeholders (Product, Engineering, Leadership). I refine the <strong>Information Architecture (IA)</strong> and complex B2B/SaaS workflows to make data and systems easy for users to manage.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="dual-edge-grid">
                <h3>Precision, Balance, and Iteration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solving Real Problems:</strong> Design is about balancing user needs and business goals. I always look for <strong>clarity</strong> and strive to solve <strong>real user problems</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fast and Smart Learning:</strong> My process involves <strong>rapid prototypes</strong> and high-quality research. I <strong>iterate aggressively</strong> to make sure the design works well in real product contexts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust and Consistency:</strong> I have found that focusing on <strong>usability improvements</strong> (small optimizations) builds long-term <strong>trust and platform consistency</strong> faster than just adding new features.</li>
