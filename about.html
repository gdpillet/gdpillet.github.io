                    <h3><span class="icon"></span>Technical Viability & Scalability</h3>
                    <p>My first four years (2010-2014), as a Web Developer equipped me for API Orchestration and technically complex design, which gave me a unique skill set as both a designer and builder. I've maintained fluency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript allowing me to evaluate user's needs, interface directly with engineering teams, implement data-driven patterns, accelerate QA and launch release new experiences.</p>

                <div class="edge-card enterprise">
                    <h3><span class="icon"></span>Enterprise Strategy & Impact</h3>
                    <p>My focus is on generating and articulating differentiated value. I specialize in creating compelling value propositions for every design solution, driving quantifiable success and customer adoption. I connect business impact metrics directly with meaningful user engagement, from strategic roadmaps to user adoption flows.</p>

                <h3><span class="icon"></span>Precision and Balance</h3>
                <p><strong>Design is the delicate art of balancing trade-offs.</strong> I strive towards clarity and solve real user problems and business goals. In early concepts: Fluidity. I start fast and loose with the team towards a big-ambitious concepts that address clear business challenge. As I refine: I work towards final solutions by co-creating detailed designs with stakeholders (product, I advocate) and rigor (working out a credibly simple to using highly complex design patterns) that ship well and problems effectively. It reflects, simplicity and craft-led making.</p>

            <div class="philosophy-item">
                <h3><span class="icon"></span>Iteration on Validation</h3>
                <p><strong>I believe UX isn't an act solely around testing hypotheses, but a controlled repeat of hypotheses generation, testing, and control around real-world.</strong> My process is grounded in continuous learning cycle within high-quality research (competitive research in controlled contexts) alongside rapid prototypes. I iterate aggressively to confirm that any design direction works in real product/market contexts that both scale easily (fit within legacy capabilities) and remain agile (can be extended quickly for new user segments). Throughout my career, I've personally observed my focus on usability (as small optimization) creates more long-term value (as trust and platform consistency) than feature creep can generate.</p>

                <ul class="principles-list">
                    <li><strong>User-informed, impact-focused.</strong> I'm building experiences rooted in quantitative data for business outcomes and deeper, user-rooted qualitative insights/validation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid learning cadence.</strong> I'm building experiences rooted fast iteration cycles and aggressive rigorous simplification without blocking ambition speed and access, user momentum.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stakeholder co-creation.</strong> I lead strategic planning and executive design review teams, then close technical deep teams that build and problems efficiently at a macro level simplicity and design excellence without ambiguous.</li>
                    <li><strong>Original value insights.</strong> Innovating the business outcomes and business outcomes can often facilitate all decision-makers and long-term development.</li>
