            <h2>Project Context</h2>
            <p>In the enterprise SaaS landscape, data security isn't just a feature—it's a fundamental requirement that can make or break major deals. This project aimed to implement Bring Your Own Encryption Key (BYOEK) functionality, allowing enterprise clients to maintain control of their encryption keys while using our platform's services.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <div class="problem-box">
                <h3>Business Challenge</h3>
                <p><strong>Enterprise security requirements were blocking major sales opportunities.</strong> Our platform's centrally-managed encryption keys, while secure, didn't meet the compliance standards of highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare, government). Prospects required customer-managed encryption keys (BYOEK) to proceed with contracts, but our platform had no native solution.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Key Issues Identified:</strong></p>
                <ul class="bullet-list">
                    <li>No customer-managed encryption option for at-rest data</li>
                    <li>Existing encryption solutions had minimal visibility and control</li>
                    <li>Risk that implementing encryption functionality would add complexity and reduce conversion</li>
                    <li>Need to balance seamless UX with stringent security requirements</li>
                    <li>Engineering team concerned about development complexity and timeline</li>
                    <li>Unclear how encryption functionality would integrate into existing product architecture</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="stat-box">

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>
            <p>I led a comprehensive discovery process to understand enterprise security requirements, competitive landscape, and technical constraints before defining the solution approach.</p>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>1. Competitive Analysis & Benchmarking</h4>
                <p>Analyzed encryption functionality implementations from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and other enterprise SaaS platforms. Documented their information architecture, workflow design, configuration complexity, and user feedback patterns.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Key Insights from Research</h3>
            <div class="insight-grid">
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Trust Through Transparency</h4>
                    <p>Enterprise users needed visibility into encryption status, key management agent health, and data migration progress to trust the system.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Configuration Complexity</h4>
                    <p>Encryption functionality requires technical setup (KMS deployment, JSON configuration) that could overwhelm non-technical stakeholders like compliance officers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Multi-Persona Requirements</h4>
                    <p>Different roles needed different views: IT teams needed technical details, executives needed high-level status, security teams needed audit logs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Migration Risk Concerns</h4>
                    <p>Users were extremely worried about data migration from legacy encryption to BYOEK and data loss were primary fears.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Ongoing Monitoring Need</h4>
                    <p>Encryption functionality isn't "set and forget"—users needed continuous health monitoring, status alerts, and diagnostic capabilities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Support Expectations</h4>
                    <p>Enterprise customers expected white-glove support during BYOEK setup but wanted self-service tools for routine monitoring.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>2. User Interviews & Workflow Mapping</h4>
                <p>Conducted 6 interviews with target customers already in sales conversations who required BYOEK. Focused on understanding: their current key management workflows, technical setup capabilities, migration concerns, and monitoring expectations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight">
                <h3>Core Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>How might we <strong>enable enterprise customers</strong> to <strong>manage their own encryption keys</strong> while maintaining platform ease-of-use, minimizing configuration complexity, and providing transparent system monitoring?</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Design Process</h2>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>3. Information Architecture & System Design</h4>
                <p>Defined how encryption functionality would integrate into existing product ecosystem. Made critical architectural decisions about entry points, agent registration flows, data migration paths, and system monitoring placement.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Solution 1: Guided Configuration Wizard</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Encryption functionality setup required customers to self-deploy a Key Management Agent (KMA) on their infrastructure and configure it via JSON files—intimidating for non-technical stakeholders.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Designed a step-by-step wizard with clear validation, examples, and warnings at each stage. Created detailed configuration guides integrated directly into the product documentation platform.</p>

            <div class="insight-grid">
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Progressive Disclosure</h4>
                    <p>Broke complex setup into manageable steps with clear progress indicators</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Inline Validation</h4>
                    <p>Real-time feedback on configuration errors with specific remediation guidance</p>
                </div>
                <div class="insight-card">
                    <h4>Example Templates</h4>
                    <p>Pre-populated JSON configuration templates reducing manual coding errors</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Solution 2: Transparent Status Dashboard</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Users needed continuous visibility into KMA health, encryption status, and potential issues—but our design system lacked patterns for technical system monitoring.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Collaborated with Design Systems team to create reusable UI patterns: status pills, alert banners, connection state indicators, and diagnostic log viewers. Built these as exportable components for future use across products.</p>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Real-time KMA connection status with color-coded health indicators</li>
                <li>Encryption coverage metrics showing which datasets were BYOEK-protected</li>
                <li>Alert system for configuration issues, connection failures, or key access problems</li>
                <li>Diagnostic logs accessible to technical users for troubleshooting</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solution 3: Safe Migration Path</h3>
            <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Migrating from legacy encryption to BYOEK was users' biggest concern—they needed assurance about data safety and minimal downtime.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> Designed a migration wizard with clear timeline estimates, rollback capabilities, and validation checkpoints. Included pre-migration testing functionality allowing users to verify configuration before committing to full migration.</p>

            <h3>Solution 4: Tiered Access Model</h3>
            <p><strong>The Discovery:</strong> Initial plan was to make encryption functionality available to all customers, but this would have complicated the UX for users who didn't need it.</p>
            <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> After design thinking workshops with PM, proposed restricting encryption functionality to Enterprise/Premium tiers. This allowed us to optimize the core platform for simplicity while providing sophisticated features where needed.</p>

            <div class="process-step">
                <h4>4. Prototyping & Validation</h4>
                <p>Created interactive Figma prototypes and conducted usability testing with 5 target customers (mix of IT staff and compliance officers). Tested configuration flow, dashboard comprehension, and migration understanding.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Critical Testing Insights</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>CLI vs. UI Dashboard Debate:</strong> Product initially wanted CLI-only interface (faster to build), but testing revealed decision-makers needed visual dashboards for status visibility without SSH access. We deprioritized other engineering tasks to build the UI dashboard first—post-launch, it became our highest-rated feature.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Results & Impact</h2>

            <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
            <p>This project taught critical lessons about balancing enterprise security requirements with user experience and managing complex stakeholder alignment.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li><strong>Transparency builds trust in security features:</strong> Users don't want "black box" security—they want clear visibility into what's happening, especially with encryption. Designing for transparency was more important than hiding complexity</li>
                <li><strong>User perception equals system trust:</strong> Technical implementation matters, but user perception of reliability and control matters equally. Status indicators and diagnostic tools were critical for confidence</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder alignment requires proactive facilitation:</strong> Competing priorities (compliance vs. speed, UI vs. API-first, power users vs. simplicity) required documented trade-off thinking and clear "why" explanations</li>
                <li><strong>Tiered access enables optimization:</strong> Restricting complex features to appropriate user segments (Enterprise tier) allowed us to optimize the core platform while serving sophisticated needs where required</li>
                <li><strong>Testing prevents wrong assumptions:</strong> CLI-only approach would have failed with decision-makers. Usability testing caught this early, saving months of post-launch rework</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Collaboration & Conflict Resolution</h3>
            <p>Worked closely with TPM to define deliverables balancing ambition and feasibility for OKRs. Secured executive buy-in by demonstrating clear business impact and phased delivery approach. Facilitated design thinking workshops between Security and Platform Engineering teams with competing priorities, resulting in aligned tiered rollout strategy.</p>

            <p>When Product proposed removing customizable peer groups to save development time, I presented research evidence showing this was the most valued feature. Collaborated to identify lower-priority features to descope instead, maintaining core user value while hitting timeline.</p>

            <h3>Design System Contribution</h3>
            <p>Created reusable patterns for system status dashboards, agent health monitoring, error codes, and diagnostic logs. These components filled gaps in our design system and accelerated future development across security, monitoring, and compliance features. Documented all patterns in Figma with usage guidelines.</p>
